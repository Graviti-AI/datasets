**IMPORTANT**: This repo is a list of open datasets hosted on Graviti. 
Please DO NOT modify this file directly. You could direct to the dataset page to contribute. Join our [slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/graviticommunity/shared_invite/zt-qivjowva-8RxtilBsHIf218sOsLTHOQ) for more communication.

- This repository is a lightweight library of [![1,233](https://img.shields.io/badge/Datasets-1%2C233-green)](https://gas.graviti.com/open-datasets)  datasets in high quality. All are open source.
- Datasets carries a diverse range of tasks, annotation types, and sizes.
- Search by task types or keywords if you need a specific dataset. You could fork a dataset on dataset page and read data through [SDK](https://github.com/Graviti-AI/tensorbay-python-sdk).

üìñ These datasets are great for machine learning learners, researchers and engineers to train models for image classification, object detection, visual relationship detection, instance segmentation, and more. </br>
‚≠ê We believe with the everyone effort from community, the open source will push the boundaries of AI towards better science understanding.
