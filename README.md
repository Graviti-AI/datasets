## Quick start

‚≠ê You have a complex problem or project involving a large amount of data and lots of variables. You know that finding a public dataset to train your machine learning model would be the best approach. How do you deal with data that‚Äôs in a variety of formats? How do you choose the dataset for your model?</br>
We'll walk you through step by step from the basics to advanced techniques and help you get started!

1. Sign up for an account

Go to [graviti.com](https://account.graviti.com/sign-up) to sign up. </br>
Get an AccessKey on [Graviti Developer Tools](https://gas.graviti.com/tensorbay/developer).</br>

> *An AccessKey is needed to authenticate identity when using TensorBay via SDK or CLI.* </br>
> *You have full permissions for the account. Please keep the key properly.*

2. Install Tensorbay Python SDK

- To install TensorBay SDK and CLI by **pip**, run the following command:
```
pip3 install tensorbay
```
- To verify the SDK and CLI version, run the following command:
```
gas --version
```
- Authorize a Client Instance
```
from tensorbay import GAS
gas = GAS("<YOUR_ACCESSKEY>")
```

3. Select an open dataset

> *You need to fork an open dataset from the community to your Graviti workspace before processing the data.*

- Search datasets from the [open dataset](https://gas.graviti.com/open-datasets) catalog [üìñ](https://docs.graviti.com/guide/opendataset/get)
- Preview the data and annotations</br>
Grasp the data details with the Pharos visualization tool in advance to help you quickly understand a dataset and its semantic information.

- On the dataset page,  choose to fork the dataset in the 'Explore Dataset' drop-down menu.

- Then you will find the dataset on the 'Your Datasets' list

4. Prepare data

You could prepare your data for model training quickly by using the following functions. 

- **Filter** [üìñ](https://docs.graviti.com/guide/tensorbay/data/filter) 
- **Merge**[üìñ](https://tensorbay-python-sdk.graviti.com/en/stable/quick_start/examples/move_and_copy.html) 
- **Move and Copy** [üìñ](https://tensorbay-python-sdk.graviti.com/en/stable/quick_start/examples/move_and_copy.html)

5. Integrate with machine learning frameworks

Integrating with PyTorch, TensorFlow and more.

- **PyTorch** [üìñ](https://tensorbay-python-sdk.graviti.com/en/latest/integrations/pytorch.htm)

The typical method to integrate a dataset with PyTorch is to build a ‚ÄòSegment‚Äô class derived from ‚Äòtorch.utils.data.Dataset‚Äô.

- **TensorFlow** [üìñ](https://tensorbay-python-sdk.graviti.com/en/latest/integrations/tensorflow.html)

The typical method to integrate a dataset with TensorFlow is to build a callable ‚ÄòSegment‚Äô class.

- We recommend enabling [cache](https://tensorbay-python-sdk.graviti.com/en/stable/advanced_features/cache.html#enable-cache) for a better training experience. Sample code is as below (It requires enough local storage to load dataset)

```
from paddle.io import Dataloader,Dataset
from PIL import Image
from tensorbay.dataset import  Dataset as TensorBay Dataset

class DogsVSCatsSegment(Dataset):
##class for wrapping a DosVsCats segment

    def __init__(self, gas, segment_name, transfors):
        super().__inint__()
        self.dataset = TensorBayDataset('DogsVsCats', gas)
        self.dataset.enable_cache() ## launch cache
        self.segment = self.dataset{segment_name}
        self.category_to_index = self.dataset.catalog.clasification.get_category_to_index()
        self.transform = transform
        print(self.datasdt.cache_enabled) ## confirm if cached has been launched
```
